            <div class="para3"><h4>Northern Soul: A Timeless Movement of Passion and Rhythm</h4></div>

<p class="para3">The Soul Brothers Syndicate deliver music with sweat, style and soul.  Northern Soul captures the heart of everyone with its energy and rare soul records.  Reborn in the dance halls of Northern England during the late sixties, Northern Soul is a form of culture that surges with vibrance, surpassing all expectations.

Northern Soul is more than a genre of music, it is a living, breathing subculture.</p>
