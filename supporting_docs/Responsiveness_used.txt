Responsiveness methods:
-----------------------
- Combination of 'vh/vw', '% of parent', and hard coded 'px' values to cater for cases where elements stretch to fill but need restricting to certain sizes on portrait/landscape screens
- Media queries to handle max/min widths of 600 and 1024 setting different flex/widths or display types 
- Image are scaled or displayed depending on screen sizes

Examples:
---------
- Sam text is 90% of screen when portrait, limited to 65% on landscape so that the text is still blocky rather than an 'acute' rectangle when stretched
- Email form and label stack vertically when narrow, alignment consistent
