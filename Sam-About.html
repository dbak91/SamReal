        <h3> About me</h3>
        <p>My main job is touring with the Soul Brothers Syndicate as a performer on the bass guitar, singer, musical arranger and announcer at the shows. <br>
          <br> I am passionate about improving people’s lives through music. <br>
          <br> Location: North Staffordshire but willing to travel to provide my services.
        </p>
        
        <p>I have lots of experience in writing the scores for every instrument for new music or for existing music. </p>
        <p>I also play keyboards and can sing so this is handy for providing backing vocals where necessary. I am happy to be in the background or in the spotlight – just pleased to be serving the music industry.</p>
        <p> I have composed and performed music for large corporations who needed music for celebratory events.
        <p>

            <h3>Music Directing</h3> I also write the scores (including some of my own composition) at every show performed by the Stoke Amateur Theatre Society, and direct all of the music as well as playing the keyboard and/or the bass guitar.

        <section class="scheme5" id="bass">
            <h3>Bass</h3> I regularly play bass guitar or keyboard for Murphy’s Marbles and other bands. In this capacity I have played in front of thousands of people at York and other horse racing events. This is mostly party music but I also play other styles, e.g. jazz funk.
